Subject: Confirmation Required: Additional Fields in Event Messages

Hello [Client],

As discussed in todayâ€™s call, we reviewed the old and new event messages and identified the following fields that are present in the old payload but missing in the new one:

SystemEnv

SystemName

StartTime

EndTime

CustomerCount (inside BatchFiles)

We will be adding these fields from the FileManager side. Could you please confirm if these changes are expected in the upcoming payloads, so that we can align our implementation accordingly?
