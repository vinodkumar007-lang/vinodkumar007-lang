I hope youâ€™re doing well.

We have completed the audit changes. While testing, we tried sending audit messages from our Kubernetes pod in Azure to the log-ecp-batch-audit topic in DEV. While the main topic (str-ecp-batch-composition-complete) works fine, the audit messages are failing with a timeout.

Upon investigation, we found the following:

It appears that the log-ecp-batch-audit topic is currently hosted on On-prem Kafka brokers:

nbpigelpdev02.africa.nedcor.net:9093

nbpproelpdev01.africa.nedcor.net:9093

nbpinelpdev01.africa.nedcor.net:9093

From our Kubernetes pod in Azure, these On-prem brokers are not reachable, resulting in timeouts:

[jboss@file-manager-655fbd4db5-np8dl app]$ curl -v telnet://nbpigelpdev02.africa.nedcor.net:9093
* Trying 10.58.150.57...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* connect to 10.58.150.57 port 9093 failed: Connection timed out
* Failed to connect to nbpigelpdev02.africa.nedcor.net port 9093: Connection timed out


Request:

To resolve this and allow our Kubernetes pod to send audit events reliably, we kindly request the following:

Create the log-ecp-batch-audit topic on Azure Kafka, similar to str-ecp-batch-composition.

Provide the Azure bootstrap servers and ensure port 9093 is accessible from our pods.

Share the necessary SSL certificates/truststore details for secure connectivity.

Please confirm that the audit topic and the corresponding Azure Kafka servers are correctly installed and accessible so we can proceed with testing.

Once this setup is in place, our audit messages should flow correctly without timeout issues.

Let us know if any additional details or tests are required from our side.

Thank you for your support.
