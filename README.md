Subject: Request to Update Container Name

Hi Turner, W. (Wayne),

Thank you for updating the accountKey. We noticed that the container currently set is nsnakscontregecm001. Could you please update it to nsneteextrm, as we have confirmed from Blob Storage that nsneteextrm is available in the ETE environment?
