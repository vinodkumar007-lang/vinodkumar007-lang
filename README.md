Thank you for your time today.

Iâ€™ve successfully completed the demo of the Kafka FileManager module. As discussed, here are the feedback points gathered during the session:

Append the file name (batchID) to the summary.json file.

Remove unwanted strings from the URLs in summary.json.

Remove any extra/unwanted fields from the processedFiles section.

I will work on implementing these changes and will notify you once the updates are completed.

Please find the relevant attachments for your reference.

Let me know if you have any further suggestions or queries.
