Yes, we do require a Docker license to proceed with creating the necessary Docker images.

In the meantime, weâ€™ve also requested the client to confirm if any open-source alternatives can be installed on my machine to support this task. We're currently awaiting their response.

Before proceeding with issuing the Docker license, could you please check with Liz Lee regarding this request?

Thank you for your support.
