Dear [IT Support/Manager's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

I am currently working on a project that requires Docker Desktop for containerization and image management. However, I encountered a message indicating that Docker Desktop usage requires a subscription or membership.

Could you please advise on the process to obtain access or whether our organization has an existing license for Docker Desktop? If a license request needs to be initiated, I would appreciate your guidance on the necessary steps.

This access is essential for loading and managing Docker images locally, which is a critical part of our deployment pipeline.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,
