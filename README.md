I am currently setting up the development environment on my Windows system. As part of this setup, I am using the following local paths for the JDK and Kafka certificate files:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
JDK Keystore Location: C:\Users\CC437236\jdk-17.0.12_windows-x64_bin\jdk-17.0.12\lib\security\keystore.jks  
Keystore Password: 3dX7y3Yz9Jv6L4F  
Key Password: 3dX7y3Yz9Jv6L4F

Truststore Location: C:\Users\CC437236\jdk-17.0.12_windows-x64_bin\jdk-17.0.12\lib\security\truststore.jks  
Truststore Password: nedbank1
To ensure proper configuration in the dev environment, Kulshan will need the equivalent Linux paths in order to set these up in her pipeline.

Could you please provide the following Linux file paths:

Location of the installed JDK

Path to the keystore file

Path to the truststore file

This will help align our local and pipeline configurations correctly.

Thank you for your support.
