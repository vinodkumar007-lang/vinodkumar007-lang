ðŸ“„ Git Branching Strategy & Release Management
1. Purpose

This document outlines the branching strategy to be followed for managing code across environments: Dev, ETE, QA, UAT, and Prod.
The strategy ensures:

Stable deployments to each environment

Clear traceability using tagID

Quick handling of production issues without disrupting development

Consistency of code across all environments

2. Branching Model
Permanent Branches

dev â€“ Base branch for active development.

prod â€“ Always reflects production code.

Release Branches (per environment)

release/ete â€“ End-to-End environment.

release/qa â€“ QA environment.

release/uat â€“ UAT environment.

release/prod â€“ Pre-production mirror for release control.

Temporary Branches

Feature branches (from dev):

feature/<tagID>-short-description


Hotfix branches (from prod):

hotfix/<tagID>-short-description

3. Normal Development Flow

Feature Creation

Developer creates branch from dev:

git checkout dev
git checkout -b feature/TAG123-new-login-api


Merge into Dev

After review, merge feature/TAG123-new-login-api â†’ dev.

Promote Across Environments

dev â†’ release/ete â†’ release/qa â†’ release/uat â†’ release/prod â†’ prod

Each promotion via Pull Request (PR).

Each step tagged for traceability:

TAG123-ete

TAG123-qa

TAG123-uat

TAG123-prod

4. Production Hotfix Flow

Branch from Prod

If an issue is found in Prod:

git checkout prod
git checkout -b hotfix/TAG201-fix-timeout


Apply Fix

Commit and test changes locally/QA.

Deploy Fix

Merge back into prod.

Tag as TAG201-prod.

Back-Merge into Lower Environments

Merge hotfix sequentially:

prod â†’ release/prod â†’ release/uat â†’ release/qa â†’ release/ete â†’ dev


Tag accordingly (TAG201-uat, TAG201-qa, etc.).

5. Example Flows
Feature Flow
feature/TAG123 â†’ dev â†’ release/ete â†’ release/qa â†’ release/uat â†’ release/prod â†’ prod

Hotfix Flow
hotfix/TAG201 â†’ prod â†’ release/prod â†’ release/uat â†’ release/qa â†’ release/ete â†’ dev

6. Tagging & Traceability

Every promotion is tagged with tagID-environment.

Example:

TAG123-ete â†’ running in ETE.

TAG123-qa â†’ running in QA.

TAG123-prod â†’ deployed to Prod.

7. Benefits

âœ… Stability per environment â€“ Each environment has its own controlled release branch.
âœ… Traceability â€“ tagID shows exactly where a change is deployed.
âœ… Fast Production Fixes â€“ Hotfixes go directly from prod and sync back down.
âœ… No Code Loss â€“ Fixes are always merged back into all environments.
âœ… Clear Audit Trail â€“ Every change is tracked with a tag and PR.

ðŸ“Œ Recommendation for Client:

Enforce Pull Request approvals for all merges.

Protect all environment branches (dev, release/*, prod) from direct commits.

Automate CI/CD pipelines to deploy code automatically when a release branch is updated.
