We are able to successfully send the required data to OpenText using the HTTP request:

http://exstream-deployment-orchestration-service.dev-exstream.svc:8900/orchestration/api/v1/inputs/ondemand/dev-SA/ECPDebtmanService

However, when using HTTPS, we are still encountering an SSL handshake exception, even though the OpenText certificate has been added to the OpenJDK truststore.

We have scheduled a call on 03-Jul-2025 from 12:30 PM to 1:30 PM IST to investigate and resolve the issue. Kindly confirm if this time works for you, or let us know your availability
