I had connected with Armand, and as per our discussion, he is expecting the following information to be included in the summary.json:

Customer details

Account details

Processed files

PrintPEF files

I have already provided him with a dummy file containing the expected structure. However, could you please advise where I can retrieve the actual data for these fields so I can populate and share the complete summary.json with him?

Looking forward to your guidance.
