Hi Du Preez, V. (Victor),

I hope you're doing well.

Due to Docker Desktop now requiring a license, there may be a slight delay in setting it up. In the meantime, the client has suggested exploring open-source alternatives. Could you kindly assist us in installing any of the following tools: Podman, Containerd, Buildah, Rancher Desktop, or Docker (if still feasible)?

Your support in this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Hi Van Vuuren, L. (Lizelle),

I am able to access https://dev.azure.com/Nedbank-Limited/, but I don't see the ECM_Exstream project or its associated repositories.

Could you please add me to the project and grant contributor access to the Git repository?

Thank you both for your assistance.
