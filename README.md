I am currently exploring Azure Blob Storage functionality and have successfully uploaded a file using code.

However, when attempting to access the file via the following direct URL:

ðŸ”— https://nsndvextr01.blob.core.windows.net/nsnakscontregecm001/dummy-file.txt

I encountered the following error:

vbnet

Status: PublicAccessNotPermitted  
Message: Public access is not permitted on this storage account.  
RequestId: 8907c508-c01e-000c-1129-c03f9f000000

This error indicates that public (anonymous) access is disabled for the storage account, preventing access to the blob through unauthenticated requests.

Next Steps:
I am trying to explore the option to provide a secure, time-limited SAS (Shared Access Signature) URL that will allow read-only access to the file. This approach maintains security while enabling access for validation or review purposes.

Alternatively, if appropriate and in line with your organizationâ€™s security policies, public access can be enabled either at the container level or storage account level to allow direct access to blobs.
