I'm not very familiar with Application Gateway configuration, but I need to access the following URL externally from Postman or a similar tool for testing:

https://<your-host>/file-manager/api/file/process

Could you please help by setting up a new App Gateway rule (if required) to expose this endpoint? The application is already running internally on port 9091.

Appreciate your support on this.
