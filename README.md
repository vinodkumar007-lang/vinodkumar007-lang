Warning:
The JKS keystore uses a proprietary format. It is recommended to migrate to PKCS12 which is an industry standard format using "keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore C:/Users/CC437236/jdk-17.0.12_windows-x64_bin/jdk-17.0.12/lib/security/New folder/cacerts -destkeystore C:/Users/CC437236/jdk-17.0.12_windows-x64_bin/jdk-17.0.12/lib/security/New folder/cacerts -deststoretype pkcs12".
