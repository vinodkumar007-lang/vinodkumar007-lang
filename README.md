Subject: Request for Kafka Producer Access to Topic

Hi [Recipient's Name],

I hope you're doing well.

I’m writing to kindly request producer access to the Kafka topic:
[your-topic-name] (please replace with the actual topic name).

We are currently able to consume messages from the topic successfully, thanks to your earlier assistance in granting us consumer access—much appreciated.

Now, as part of the next phase of our integration, we need to produce/publish messages to the same topic from our file management service. This is essential for sending summary payloads after successful file uploads, which are required by downstream consumers in the [project/system name].

At the moment, attempts to produce messages are failing due to authorization errors.

Please let me know if any additional information or approvals are needed from our side.

Thank you again for your continued support.
