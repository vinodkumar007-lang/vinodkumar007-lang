Request for Kafka Access to Topic and Consumer Group

I am currently setting up a Kafka consumer to read from the topic log-ecp-batch-audit on the ETE environment. However, Iâ€™m getting an authorization error:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
Not authorized to access group: ecp-batch-audit-consumer
Could you please help grant our client access to the following:

Read access to the topic: log-ecp-batch-audit

Read access to the consumer group: ecp-batch-audit-consumer

Let me know if you need any further details from my side.
