✅ Let’s Fix This Cleanly Using Git Credential Manager
We'll skip embedding the PAT in the URL, and instead use Git Credential Manager, which securely prompts for credentials and stores them properly.

🔧 Step 1: Enable Git Credential Manager (GCM)
Run this in Git CMD:

cmd
Copy
Edit
git config --global credential.helper manager-core
This enables the Windows credential popup when Git needs authentication.

🔁 Step 2: Clear Any Bad Credentials
Run:

cmd
Copy
Edit
git credential-manager clear
Then go to Windows Credential Manager:

Open Control Panel

Click Credential Manager

Go to Windows Credentials

Remove any entries for dev.azure.com

🔁 Step 3: Clone Without PAT in the URL
Now try cloning without embedding your PAT:

cmd
Copy
Edit
git clone https://dev.azure.com/Nedbank-Limited/ECM_Exstream/_git/ECM_comp_Exstream_Dev
When prompted:

Username: CC437236

Password: Paste your PAT

💡 The prompt might say "Password", but you must enter the PAT there — not your real login password.

✅ Step 4: PAT Success Checklist
If this still fails:

Double-check your PAT starts with something like ghp_... (GitHub style) or Azure’s own format (often a long alphanumeric string).

Re-create a new PAT at Azure DevOps Token Settings

Make sure you grant:

✅ Code > Read & Write

✅ Organization: Nedbank-Limited

🛠 Final Tip (Optional for Security)
After a successful clone:

cmd
Copy
Edit
git config --global credential.helper manager-core
…will cache your PAT securely for future use (so you won’t need to re-enter it again).

Would you like me to walk you through regenerating the correct PAT with screenshots or scopes?
