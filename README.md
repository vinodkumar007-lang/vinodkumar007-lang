Regarding the importance of Docker Desktop and its current status as a blocker, I believe that while Docker Desktop is important for the final steps of building the Docker image and pushing it to Docker Hub, it is not an immediate blocker for the team to proceed with the Kafka/File Manager development and testing.

As of now, the File Manager development is actively in progress, and our team is making good strides. The Kafka work is progressing smoothly, with close collaboration between the team and Akash. The team is focused on completing the development tasks, and we are confident that we can proceed with the necessary work even while Docker Desktop is being set up.

Once the end-to-end flow is completed, Docker Desktop will play a crucial role in the final deployment steps, but for now, the team can continue to develop and test the Kafka/File Manager components without it.

We are committed to ensuring that the project progresses efficiently, and we will continue to keep you updated on our progress.

Thank you for your continuous support, and please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out if you need any further clarification.
